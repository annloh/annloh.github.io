# Have a little style

A style guide is a manuscript that defines conventions on how code of a particular language should be structured and written. Basically a list of do's and don'ts that
make code a lot more readable. You can compare it to typesetting conventions for normal text.

The same is true for code. 

And similar to most people only ever following one comma rule (if in doubt leave it out) a lot of people happily use R for half a decade without ever learning about the
existence of coding conventions.

However, R not only has one but two popular styleguides.

The tidyverse guide by Hadley Wickham

and the google style guide

And while I personally don't mind missing commas in writing reading code that 
looks like this:


or this:

makes me cringe and loose my will to live. 

Now you might argue those are certainly extreme examples which I completely made
up. Unfortunately not. 
(They were slightly modified to protect the identity of the author though.)
